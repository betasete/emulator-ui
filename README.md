# CloudWalk Emulator v0.0.1

CloudWalk Emulator as you might guess is a smartphone (and POS) emulator built with HTML,
CSS, and Javascript.

## What's new

This is the first draft, which is going to be heavily changed during the next weeks! Keep
an eye on it and be prepared for some awesomeness =)

## What's coming

There are many things coming out on next weeks, including:

* jQuery Mobile
* Emulator's virtual keyboard bindings (to your own keyboard)
* Integration with [CloudWalk IDE](https://ide.cloudwalk.io/hello.rb)
* Complete application flow navigation
